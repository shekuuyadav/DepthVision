# **App Name**: DepthVision

## Core Features:

- Depth Map Creation: Use generative AI tools to estimate depth information from a 2D image or video frame. This module takes the 2D media as input and outputs a depth map.
- 3D View Rendering: Renders a 3D scene using the depth map and original image/video frame as a texture.
- Media Upload: Allow users to upload images or videos from their local filesystem, or copy the contents of an image from a URL. Support common image and video formats.
- Camera Controls: Enable users to control the viewing angle and zoom of the 3D view using mouse or touch gestures. Provide preset camera positions for quick navigation.
- Export: Enable the ability to download the generated view as a shareable video file.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#3D84A8), echoing a sense of natural depth and perception.
- Background color: Off-white (#F0F4F8), providing a clean, neutral backdrop to showcase the 3D renders.
- Accent color: Deep blue (#22577A), used to highlight interactive elements and call-to-action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font to ensure readability.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent camera controls and export options.
- Split-screen layout: original image/video on one side, and 3D view on the other.
- Subtle animations for loading and depth processing to engage users without distracting from the 3D view.
